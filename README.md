Pig game 🐷

Pig game is a simple game for two where you can roll the dice and collect the points, the one who collects 100 points - wins. 
Once you roll and get 1, players are switching. 
If you want to collect the points you can hold your score and give your round to the other player. 
Otherwise keep playing, but be aware that your chances to roll any number different than 1 is always 5/6 (around 83%)!

Good luck 🎲 !
